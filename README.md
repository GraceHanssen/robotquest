# Robotquest
A set of exercises to build progressively small program wit Test Driven Development. 

> **Credits:** The application (the program) is based on the existing [Robot-app from **HackYourFuture**](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/RobotApp). The exercises are originals and made to fit the We Ignite Tech program. 

We will use some of the features existing in the HYF Robot-app. It might be usefull to understand them before starting the exercises. Please read: 
 * [The introduction](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/RobotApp#introduction) 
 * [Some details about the game](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/RobotApp#robot-state)
 * [How the robot turns](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/RobotApp#turning-the-robot)
 * [How the robot moves](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/RobotApp#moving-the-robot)

 **Important**: the game will run on the command-line for terminal (read: non-graphic) environment. No knowledge on CSS and HTML is required for the exercises. Just JavaScript.  

## How-to
> `Fork` this repository under your GitHub profile and `clone` it. Read the instructions and `commit` and `push` your code to the same repository. 

Each exercise is described on this page. 

## Overall description of the exercises

### Exercise 1 - Some code to be refactored
In the `ex1` folder you will find an early version of the robot-app. 

Open the content of `ex1` as a project in IntelliJ by doing like this: 
 - open IntelliJ
 - choose `open project`
 - navigate to `ex1`, and press `open`

This will open the code as an independent project. This project only contains one file: `main.js`. Open this file. And pay attention to the code. 

The code seems harmless for our computer, so we can run it in order to understand how the code works.  

Open a `terminal` and go to the `ex1` folder of this repository. Run the command: `node main.js`. This command tells the program `Node` to run the code in `main.js`. 

What do this program do? 

Looking back to the code, can you identify som _refactorings_?

Try them out! And remember to run the program on the _command line_ each time you make a change in the source code.
